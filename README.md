# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.

## Algorithm:

1.Solution Ideation: Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app). Task: Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise. Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.

2.Creating User Stories: Use personas and their goals to write user stories. Task: Write at least 5 user stories using this format: As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

3.Creating Scenarios: Select a user story. Task: Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context. Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.

4.Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping: Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app). Task: Draw a task flow diagram or user flow. Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).

5.Information Architecture (IA): Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal). Task: Perform card sorting (open or closed). Create a site map showing categorized structure.


## Output:

1. Solution Ideation (Crazy 8s or Brainwriting) 
Problem: Booking an appointment in a hospital app is confusing and time-consuming. 

Crazy 8s (Sketch 8 ideas in 8 minutes) 
Here are 8 quick low-fidelity ideas:

1. One-tap “Book Now” button on the home screen. 
2. Doctor list with availability shown as color-coded dots. 
3. Voice-enabled appointment booking. 
4. “Next available” auto-book option. 
5. Appointment summary screen with reschedule/cancel option. 
6. Filter doctors by specialty, gender, rating. 
7. Chat with AI assistant to book appointment. 
8. Map view of hospital branches with tap-to-book functionality.

2. Creating User Stories 
Assume the persona is Ravi, a 34-year-old working professional. 

User Stories:
1. As a busy user, I want to book a doctor quickly, so that I don’t waste time navigating 
the app. 
2. As a new patient, I want to see doctor reviews, so that I can choose a reliable 
physician. 
3. As a repeat visitor, I want to rebook with the same doctor, so that I maintain treatment 
continuity. 
4. As a user with poor eyesight, I want large, clear buttons, so that I can use the app 
comfortably. 
5. As a parent, I want to book appointments for my child, so that I can manage family 
healthcare easily.

3. Creating Scenarios 
Selected User Story: 
As a busy user, I want to book a doctor quickly, so that I don’t waste time navigating the 
app. 

Scenario:

Ravi, a marketing manager, opens the hospital app during a short break at work. He's 
anxious because he has had a cough for a week and wants to consult a general physician 
today. Sitting in a noisy office with only 10 minutes to spare, he wants a frictionless way to 
book. He uses the quick-book feature, filters doctors by availability, and confirms the nearest 
hospital slot. He feels relieved and satisfied that the task was fast and efficient.
